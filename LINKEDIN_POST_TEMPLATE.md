## Option 1: Problem-Solution Format (Recommended)

```
🚀 Automating My DevOps Learning Journey

THE PROBLEM:
As I started my DevOps journey, I quickly got overwhelmed.

9+ certifications (Terraform, Kubernetes, CKAD, ArgoCD, Prometheus...)
4+ hands-on AWS/EKS projects
Complex dependencies between courses
Hundreds of checklist items

Managing all this manually in Trello was taking 30-45 minutes each time I updated my plan. Time I could've spent actually LEARNING!

THE SOLUTION:
I built a Python automation script that transforms a structured JSON learning plan into organized Trello cards automatically.

⚡ Setup time: 10 seconds (from 45 minutes)
✅ Automated card creation with checklists
✅ Dependency tracking between courses
✅ Learning stage management

THE TECH:
• Python + Trello API
• JSON for structured data
• Automated board organization

THE RESULT:
• More time for actual learning
• Clear visual roadmap
• Easy to update and maintain
• Reduced cognitive overhead

💡 Key Takeaway: If you find yourself doing something repetitive, automate it!

Made it open source so others can use it for their learning journeys too.

## Option 2: Story Format

```
From Overwhelmed to Organized: Automating My DevOps Learning Path 📚

3 months ago, I decided to commit to learning DevOps.

I created a spreadsheet with:
→ 9 certification courses
→ 4 hands-on projects
→ Dependencies between them
→ Checklists for each module

Then came the hard part: keeping it organized.

Every week, I spent 30-45 minutes manually creating Trello cards, copying descriptions, adding checklists, and tracking dependencies.

That's when I realized: I'm studying AUTOMATION, yet doing manual work! 🤦‍♂️

So I did what any aspiring DevOps engineer would do:

I AUTOMATED IT. ⚙️

Built a Python script that:
✅ Reads a JSON learning plan
✅ Creates Trello cards automatically
✅ Adds checklists and descriptions
✅ Tracks course dependencies
✅ Organizes everything in seconds

Time to setup my board now? 10 seconds.
Time saved per week? 30+ minutes.
Time to build the automation? 2 hours.

Worth it? ABSOLUTELY.

The best part? I learned:
• API integration
• JSON data structures
• Workflow automation
• How to solve real problems with code

I made it open source so you can use it for your learning journey too!
